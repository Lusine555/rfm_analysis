## rfm_analysis
 
For this project I have created a python package for RFM Analysis. RFM analysis is a marketing technique used to quantitatively rank and group customers based on the recency, frequency and monetary total of their recent transactions to identify the best customers and perform targeted marketing campaigns. The package defines three functions for calculating RFM (recency, frequency, and monetary value) scores for a given set of customer data, segmenting the customers based on those scores, and creating a personalized marketing campaign for each customer based on their segment.

The calculate_rfm_scores function takes a DataFrame of customer data as input and returns a DataFrame of RFM scores for each customer. It calculates the recency score by dividing the maximum recency value by the recency value of each customer, and then subtracting the result from 5. It calculates the frequency score and the monetary value score in a similar manner.

The segment_customers function takes a DataFrame of RFM scores as input and returns a DataFrame with an additional column for customer segment. It assigns a "bronze" segment to customers with a recency score of 3 or less, a "silver" segment to customers with a recency score greater than 3 but less than or equal to 4, and a "gold" segment to customers with a recency score greater than 4.

The create_campaign function takes a DataFrame of RFM scores with a column for customer segment as input and returns a dictionary mapping customer IDs to personalized marketing campaigns. It iterates through the rows of the DataFrame and assigns a different campaign message to each customer based on their segment. Customers in the "bronze" segment receive a discount offer, customers in the "silver" segment receive a free shipping offer, and customers in the "gold" segment receive a special gift offer.
